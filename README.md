# 3D Vector Plot
This is a three-dimensional graphing tool for vectors as well as vector-adjacent concepts in linear algebra. I created this primarily as a visualization tool for myself and as a fun project, but I hope you find it interesting and/or useful as well!

## Features
* Graph with three coordinate planes and axes
* GUI to add vectors and planes to the graph as well as display information
* Adjustable grid scale and camera angle

## What's Next?
* Ability to visualize more mathematical concepts (linear projections, normal vectors, etc)
* Export/import system to save the current state of the plot or share it with others
* More customization (colours, styles, etc)
